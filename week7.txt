For the practice of week 7, I decided to create a simple transition and animation with a simple math quiz using Vue.js. Props are the way components can accept data from components that include them (parent components). When a component expects one or more prop, it must define them in its props property. Unlike components and props, event names don't provide any automatic case transformation. Instead, the name of an emitted event must exactly match the name used to listen to that event. Furthermore, We can create components that are loaded from the server only when itâ€™s needed with async components. To do this, instead of passing in an object as the second argument, we pass in a function that returns a promise instead. For the interface, there would be a calculation and we have to choose the right answer. If the correct answer is chosen, there would be a transition and animation changing to the new question.
